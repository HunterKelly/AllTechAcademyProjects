# AllTechAcademyProjects
 All The Tech Academy Projects in one repository
 
 Originally, Most of the projects were in seperate repositories, but they have been merged into one large directly for easy reference.
 Inside there are Python, HTML,CSS,JS, C# projects.
 
 The python projects were the first assignments from The Tech Academy. 
 They include simple console.log lines of code, and some basic arithmetic.
 
HTML and JS are several sample websites including a Pizza website, Calculator, and a personal portfolio.

The C# contains the meat and potatos of my C# course. It has every kind of loop, enums, algorithms and much more. Great for referencing syntax or methods.
Lastly, there are samples from the C# Live Project, where I got to work on a team as an intern developing a site for a Theatre Production site. There is a seperate repository that goes into further detail. See TALIVEPROJECT repository.
